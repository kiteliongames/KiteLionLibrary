At the start of every new project, copy the '_FileStructureTemplate' folder into your new project. Then rename '_FileStructureTemplate' the name of your project (NO SPACES!).
Such that your File Structure is /MyProject/Assets/MyProject/.
Yes I am aware that seems silly, take it up with Unity: https://unity.com/how-to/organizing-your-project#folder-structure.
